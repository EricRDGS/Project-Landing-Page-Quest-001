## 🗺️ Overview

The challenge is a simple landing page with a logo, background image, image in the content, texts and social media icons. But for me it's a bit complex, because there are a lot of things that I'm evolving, like the flex display and the grid.

### 📝The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Display flex e display grid;
- Responsiveness.
